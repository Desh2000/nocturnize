# 1. SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT PARAMETERS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. SRI LANKA CEB TARIFF PARAMETERS (as of late 2024/early 2025)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This section models the real-world Time-of-Day (ToD) tariff structure
# provided by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for domestic users.
# All prices are in Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR) per kWh.

# Define the time periods in 24-hour format.
# Note: The 'end' hour is exclusive (e.g., 22.5 means up to 10:29 PM).

# 3. DQN AGENT & TRAINING HYPERPARAMETERS
